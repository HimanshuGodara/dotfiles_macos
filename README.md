Automating ðŸ›   development  environment creation

I'm learning a ton about [dotfiles, command line use, Homebrew, zsh, git, macOS and more with the course ***Dotfiles from Start to Finish-ish***](http://dotfiles.eieio.xyz/) by [@EIEIOxyz](https://twitter.com/EIEIOxyz/), and you can too!


## TODO
- Terminal Preferences
- Changed Shell to ZSH
- Dock Preferences
- Mission Control Preferences (Don't rearrange spaces)
- Finder Show Path bar & Status Bar
- Trackpad (3 finger drag & tap to click)
- Git (Config and SSH)
- Share this repo with a million people
